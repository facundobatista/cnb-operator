  environment:

    description: |
      Stringified JSON array that allows you to specify how data coming through
      relations is exposed as environment variables to your application. For example,
      the following will use Jinja2 to template the value of two environment
      variables `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST` and `SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PORT` based on
      the "hostname" and "port" properties of the consumed `mongodb` relation:

      ```
      [
        {
          "name": "SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST",
          "value": "{{relations.consumed.mongodb.hostname}}"
        },
        {
          "name": "SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PORT",
          "value": "{{relations.consumed.mongodb.port}}"
        }
      ]
      ```

      Refer to README.md#relations for an overview of which relations are supported and
      what attributes they expose.

  files:
    type: string
    default: '[]'
    description: |
      Stringified JSON array that allows you to specify how data coming through
      relations is exposed as files in the container of your application. For example,
      the following will use Jinja2 to template the content of the `/my/mongodb/configuration`
      file using the `hostname` and `port` properties of the consumed `mongodb` relation:

      ```
      [
        {
          "path": "/my/mongodb/configuration",
          "content": "mongodb://{{relations.consumed.mongodb.hostname}}:{{relations.consumed.mongodb.port}}/my_database"
        }
      ]
      ```

      Refer to README.md#relations for an overview of which relations are supported and
      what attributes they expose.
